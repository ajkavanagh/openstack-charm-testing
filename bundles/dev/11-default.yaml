# 11-Machine Bare Metal Example with MAAS Tagging & Service Placement
# ===================================================================
#   /!\ Not Reference Architecture: for Testing Only /!\
# lp:~1chb1n   irc:beisner   fn  #juju  or  #ubuntu-server
#
# User Scenario:
#   * There is 1 machine, with low storage, less compute capacity, but with a
#     pair of NICs intended to be the cloud's edge/gateway.
#
#   * There are 6 machines tagged as "storage."  These machines contain less
#     compute and more storage, and/or more resilient or performant storage.
#
#   * There are 3 machines tagged as "object."  While these machines are are
#     also tagged as "storage," they are preferred for serving blobs.
#
#   * There are 3 machines tagged as both "object" and to specific swift
#     zones (1 machine per zone).  This is necessary due to failure domains
#     in this mock datacenter.
#
#   * There is 1 machine tagged as "database."  This machine has been
#     specifically designed to house database services.
#
#   * Without hard-coding addresses or other unique machine identifiers,
#     deploy the services to the appropriate "classes" of metal in a
#     simple and repeatable way.
