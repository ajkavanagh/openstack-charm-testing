bundles/ppc64
=============

These ppc64el/powerkvm bundles are mostly experimental proofs-of-concept,
still in active development and testing.

Differentiating bundle naming and purposes:
  PowerKVM        Power7 or 8 box with IBM's fedora-based host operating system.
                  ie. "cutting"

  ppc64el         Power8 box with Ubuntu as the host operating system.
                  ie. "gregory"
