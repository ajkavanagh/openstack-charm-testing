# /!\ Experimental Proof-of-Concept /!\
#
# PowerKVM + x86 mixed stack (7 physical machines):
#     (7) amd64 hosts [for API and non-compute services]
#     (1) PowerKVM host [for compute only]
#
#  Notes:
#   * The nova-compute-power charm is a proxy charm.  It handles
#     operations against the PowerKVM (IBM fedora-based) metal host.
#   * The PowerKVM unit itself is not managed by maas, and is not
#     directly managed by juju as a service unit.
#
#  Necessary Prep:
#   * IBM ISO must be mounted on the PowerKVM unit.
#   * The PowerKVM unit must be configured to accept an ssh key, and that pub key
#      must be stored in the locally branched ./trusty/nova-compute-power/files/
#      charm directory (path relative to the openstack-charm-testing checkout).
#   * The PowerKVM unit must have a static IP address configured in advance.
#   * The ./configure command below calls a profile in the ./profiles/ dir,
#     which may need to be adjusted to fit the IP range of the current
#     environment.
#
#  Example - deployment:
#    bzr branch lp:openstack-charm-testing
#    cd openstack-charm-testing
#    juju bootstrap --constraints arch=amd64
#    juju-deployer -v -c bundles/ppc64/powerkvm-fullstack.yaml -d trusty-kilo
#
#  Note - After deploy is "complete," watch juju debug-log and wait for
#         hooks to settle before proceeding.
#
#  Example - basic api functional checks:
#  Commands should all exit 0.  Some may return empty lists, that is ok.
#    . novarc
#    nova list
#    nova service-list
#    nova hypervisor-list  # expect the powerkvm host to be listed
#    neutron net-list
#    keystone user-list
#    keystone catalog
#    keystone endpoint-list
#    glance image-list
#    cinder list
#
#  Example - configure the cloud:
#    ./configure powerkvm
#
#  Example - quick cloud functional validation:
#    tools/instance_launch 3 trusty-ppc64el
#    tools/float_all.sh
#    . novarc   # get the cloud credentials
#    nova list  # choose an instance and get its floating ip
#    ssh -i ~/testkey.pem <instance-floating-ip>
