bundles/sparse
==============

These bundles generally do not use lxc or kvm smoosh tactics.

The following bundles are consumed by UOSCI in automated charm
deployment testing.  They are the working dev bundles, updated
throughout each dev cycle.  Functionally identical, only the
charm sources should differ.  New charm config options and new
relations may be added to next.yaml during the charm dev cycle.

Upon each OpenStack charm release, the default.yaml needs to be
edited to reflect any new config options/relations/targets.

default.yaml    stable charm branches
next.yaml       development charms
