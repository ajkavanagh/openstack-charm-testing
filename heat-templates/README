HEAT TEMPLATES DIR


About
=======
  The heat git project has several heat (aka HOT) templates available.
  Generally those can be used directly.  Some enhancements and modifications
  may be necessary in our testing, such as adding the network id parameter
  in the basic helloworld template (upstream template didn't have that).


Example Usage
=============
  heat stack-create heat_basic -f heat-templates/heat-basic.yaml \
    --parameters "admin_pass=Ubuntu;key_name=testkey;image=cirros;network=private"

  heat stack-list
